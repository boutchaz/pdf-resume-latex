# Prerequisites

I'm using ubunutu as an operating system. If you want to enable latex support you need to install :
    * texlive-full : TeX Live is a TeX distribution to get up and running with the TeX document production system. To install it, once you're in the terminal, enter the following command:
        ```bash
        sudo apt-get install texlive-full
        ```
